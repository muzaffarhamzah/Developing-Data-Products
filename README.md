# Course Project Shiny Application & Reproducible Pitch

This proposed `shiny` web application is developed in R Studio.
This application has two functions:

- Predicting music suggestions according to chosen `mood`
- Predicting movie suggestions according to chosen `genre`

This application mainly demonstrates on developing an interactive application. 
Future work will contain the implementation of a proper algorithm.
